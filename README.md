# Pool Game Setup

### Description

This is a fun and interactive pool game setup designed for 2 to 5 players. Each player is randomly assigned a set of three unique pool ball numbers from a total of 15 balls. The goal is to get rid of all the other balls and be the first to clear your set of numbers. Each player will not know the numbers of the other players, ensuring fairness and surprise!

### How to Play

1.  Select Number of Players:

- Choose the number of players (between 2 and 5) by clicking the corresponding button.

3.  Generate Random Pool Balls:

- Once the number of players is selected, click the "Generate Numbers" button to generate and assign 3 random pool ball numbers to each player. These numbers are assigned without overlap, so no two players will have the same numbers.

5.  View Assigned Pool Balls:

- Each player will get a chance to see their assigned pool balls. After clicking the "Show Numbers" button, the corresponding pool ball images will appear.

- Once the numbers are revealed, they will be hidden again after moving to the next player.

7.  Next Player:

- After a player has seen their numbers, you can click "Next Player" to proceed to the next player.

- If it's the last player's turn, the button will change to "Start Over", allowing you to restart the game and assign new random numbers to the players.

9.  Objective:

- The game's objective is to eliminate all the other balls from your set. Each player's numbers are unique, so there will be no overlap between players.

### Notes:

- The game is designed for fair play, with each player seeing their own numbers but never knowing the numbers of others.

- The pool balls are represented by images, giving the game a more realistic look and feel.
